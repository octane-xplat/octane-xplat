# Documentation coverage

Paths in code spans refer to the repository root. Read this reference when its
subject applies to your task; [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) is the entry point.

[Recipes](../../recipes/README.md) define the non-trivial developer workflows that
need documentation and the criteria for complete coverage. Before changing
public behavior, setup, or a supported workflow, inspect recipes by outcome and
related API name. Add or update the affected recipe, supporting docs, and
maintained examples in the same change; pure refactors ordinarily need none.
Do not weaken criteria to hide an implementation limitation.

Record criterion coverage and verification evidence separately in Silo's
`recipe_audit` table, following the recipe guide. Run `pnpm check:recipes`.
At handoff, identify affected recipes and remaining gaps, or briefly explain
why no recipe is affected. A public workflow change is not finished until its
recipe and documentation are reconciled and any remaining gap is explicit.
