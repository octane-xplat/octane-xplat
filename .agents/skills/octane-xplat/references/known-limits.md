# Limits and evidence

Before promising behavior, read the relevant entries in the
[public known limits](../../../../docs/testing/known-limits.md) and the feature's
guide. That page owns consumer-facing support boundaries; do not treat this
skill as a duplicate support matrix. Match guidance to the installed package
version and check each entry's evidence/version stamp.

A typechecked export or successful build proves a different claim from a
running platform assertion. Object-driver tests do not establish OS input,
hit-testing, accessibility, or pixel parity. Follow [testing](testing.md) when
choosing checks and report only the targets actually run.

For a boundary or workaround investigation, read the applicable internal record:

- [Portal ownership](../../../docs/notes/portal-boundaries.md): independent-root
  fallbacks, platform exceptions, owner lifetime, and qualified fixtures.
- [Mason cutover](../../../docs/notes/masonkit-layout-evaluation.md): native
  layout implementation, migration boundaries, and remaining qualification gaps.
- [AppKit verification](../../../docs/appkit-verification.md): geometry and
  lifecycle evidence, including CSS positioned edges after the layout cutover.
- [Upstream limitations](../../../docs/upstream-limitations.md): how to verify
  and record upstream scope and local workarounds.
- [NativeScript runtimes: V8 without ICU](../../../docs/notes/nativescript-no-icu.md):
  NativeScript iOS/Android V8 lacks ICU — no `Intl`, no `\p{…}` regexes (a
  literal fails its whole module at parse time), no normalization.

Uncharacterized lab flakes belong with their investigation records and Silo,
not in an undated skill list. A historical failure is not automatically a
current limitation, and a fixed fixture is not blanket platform qualification.
